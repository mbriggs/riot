## Getting Started

In contrast to other popular Ruby testing frameworks such as Test::Unit, [Shoulda](http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda) and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), Riot does not run a `setup` and `teardown` sequence before and after each test. This speeds up the test runs quite a bit, but also puts restrictions on how you write your tests. In general, Riot doesn't think you should be mutating any objects under test for a given `context`.

Which is a great segue into this little tid-bit, in Riot tests reside in `contexts`. Within these, a `topic` object is defined through a `setup` block. The actual assertions are then made with an `assert` block. For instance:

    context "An Array" do
      setup { Array.new }
      asserts("is empty") { topic.empty? }
    end # An Array

As you can see, the `setup` block doesn't use any instance variables to save the object under test -- rather, the return value of the `setup` block is used as the `topic`. This object can then be accessed in the assertions using the `topic` attribute. Furthermore, at their very basic level, assertions need only return a boolean; `true` indicates a pass, while `false` indicates a fail.

Of course, you can nest contexts as well; the `setup` blocks are executed outside-in; as in, the parents' `setups` are run before the current `context` allowing for a setup hierarchy; this is also what you would expect from other frameworks.

    context "An Array" do
      setup { Array.new }

      context "with one element" do
        setup { topic << "foo" }
        asserts("array is not empty") { !topic.empty? }
        asserts("returns the element on #first") { topic.first == "foo" }
      end
    end # An Array

By the way, you can put use any kind of ruby object in your context description. Riot will call `to_s` on the actual value before it is used in a reporting context. This fact will become useful later ;)

### Assertion Macros

Well, how useful would Riot be if you could only return true/false from an assertion? Pretty useful, actually; but, we can make it more useful! No; that's not crazy. No it isn't. Yes; I'm sure.

We can do this with assertion macros. You can think of these as special assertion modifiers that check the return value of the assertion block. Actually, it's not that you **can** think of them this way; you **should** think of them this way.

Let's take this little for instance:

    context "Yum" do
      setup { ["cookies", "donuts"] }
      asserts("#first") { topic.first }.equals("cookies")
    end # Yum

First, how's that for a readable test? Second, you should notice that the assertion block will return the `first` item in from the `topic`, which is assumed to be `Enumerable`. If it isn't, then you have other problems. Since the first element in the array is "cookies", the assertion will pass. Yay!

But wait, there's more. Riot is about helping you write tests faster and to be more readable. Notice any duplication in the example above (besides the value "cookies")? I do. How about that `first` notation in the assertion name and reference in the assertion block. Riot provides a shortcut which allows you reference methods on the topic through the assertion name. Here's another way to write the same test:

    context "Yum" do
      setup { ["cookies", "donuts"] }
      asserts(:first).equals("cookies")
    end # Yum

Now that's real yum.

There are a bunch of [built-in assertion macros](AssertionMacros.markdown). Elsewhere, we'll explain to you how to write your own.

### Setups, Hookups, and Helpers

We're not done yet; there's plenty more cool stuff for you to know about. You know about `setup` already; but you may not know that you can call `setup` multiple times within a Context. Well, you can. They run in the order you write them (top-down) and the result of a prior `setup` will be the `topic` for the next setup. In this way you **could** chain together some partitioned setup criteria without ever explicitly setting a variable (instance or local).

    context "A cheesey order" do
      setup { Cheese.create!(:name => "Blue") }
      setup { Order.create!(:cheese => topic, :purchase_order => "123-abc") }
      
      asserts_topic.kind_of(Order) # I love tests that are readable
    end # A cheesey order

This notion about a prior `setup` being the `topic` for a latter `setup` is true even when the `setup` is called from a parent Context.

More than likely, however, you'll want to modify something about the topic without changing what the topic for the context is. To do this, Riot provides the `hookup` block, which is just like a `setup` block except that `hookup` will always return the `topic` that was provided to it. It's kind of like calling `Object#tap`. Here's a for-instance:

    context "A Person" do
      setup { Person.new(:name => "Master Blasterr") }

      asserts(:valid?).not!

      context "with valid email" do
        hookup { topic.email = "master@blast.err" }
        asserts(:valid?) # Yay!
      end # with valid email
    end # A complex thing

If the point didn't smack you in the face there, think about using `setup` instead of `hookup` in the sub-context. Had you written that as a `setup` block, you'd have to return `topic` after setting the email address, or else the new topic would be the actual email address; and you probably don't want to actually be calling `"master@blast.err".valid?` in the assertion.

You can also call `hookup` as many times as you like; the great part is that the `topic` never changes.

#### Helpers

You remember how you used to - or currently do - create instance variables to hold some data that you're going to use in your tests? Well, Riot allows you to still do that yucky stuff, but would rather you use a helper to encapsulate it. For instance, you could do this:

    context "A greedy monkey" do
      setup do
        @a_banana = Banana.new(:ripe => true)
        Monkey.new
      end

      hookup { topic.takes(@a_banana) }

      asserts(:bananas).size(1)
    end # A greedy monkey

Or, you could do this

    context "A greedy monkey" do
      helper(:a_banana) { Banana.new(:ripe => true) }
      setup { Monkey.new }
      hookup { topic.takes(a_banana) }
      asserts(:bananas).size(1)
    end # A greedy monkey

"So! What's the difference?", you ask. Nothing really. It's all aesthetic; but, it's a better aesthetic for a couple of reasons. Let me tell you why:

1. Helpers are good ways to encapsulate related setup data and give that data namespace
2. The act of setting up data does not clutter up your setups or assertions
3. I'll argue that it makes the code more readable; ex. how do you verbalize to your friends `@a_banana` and `a_banana`. In the former, I probably say "at a banana" and think "Why do I sound like a muppet when I talk?".
3. Being that helpers are blocks, you can actually pass arguments to them

What's that about (4)? Yes, helpers are really just over-glorified methods, which means you can pass arguments to them. Which means you can build factories with them. Which means those factories can go away when the context is no longer used and they're no longer cluttering up your object space. You want another for instance, eh?

    context "A greedy monkey" do
      helper(:make_a_banana) do |color|
        Banana.new(:color => color)
      end

      setup { Monkey.new }

      hookup do
        topic.takes(make_a_banana("green"))
        topic.takes(make_a_banana("blue"))
      end

      asserts(:bananas).size(2)
      asserts("green bananas") { topic.bananas.green }.size(1)
      asserts("blue bananas") { topic.bananas.blue }.size(1)
    end # A greedy monkey

Or you could `make_many_bananas` or whatever. There are also lots of clever ways to get helpers included into a context which you will hopefully see when you read up on Context Middleware and look through the Recipes. Riot Rails makes liberal use of helpers when [setting up a context](http://github.com/thumblemonks/riot-rails/master/lib/riot/action_controller/context_middleware.rb) to test controllers.

Again, you define as many helpers as you like; you can also replace existing helpers by simply defining a helper with the same name (*that's because they're just methods defined within the context instance ... shhh*).
